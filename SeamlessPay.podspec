    The SeamlessPay iOS SDK makes it quick and easy to build an excellent payment experience in your iOS app. We provide powerful elements that can be used out-of-the-box to collect your usersâ€™ payment details. We also expose the low-level APIs that power those UIs so that you can build fully custom experiences.
